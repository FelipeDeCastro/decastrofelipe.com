          <p class="mt-small">We are all cosmic dusty attached to this big blue rock floating in the space, therefore we need to <strong>support each other</strong> and <strong>take care of our planet</strong>. The natural things surrounding us wasn’t made for us, living creatures, but <strong>it’s up to us, human-beings, to make it a better place to live</strong>.<br/>‍<br/>This is a very valuable belief for a Product Designer because <strong>our work is all about being emphatic and improving customer’s lives,</strong> thus it’s very fulfilling and motivational. Plus, it makes me a better team player giving <strong>equal importance to the journey as to the destinatio</strong>n, to the end-user and business owners as to my teammates and colleagues.</p>

          <h3 class="mt-medium">Globo.com | 2008 - 2010</h3>
          <p class="mt-small">My career started in 2008 at <strong>Globo.com</strong>, the web arm of the <strong>largest media company in Latin America</strong>. I was a member of the <strong>UX design team</strong> and worked with a <strong>scrum cross-functional team</strong> developing <strong>new features for the portal</strong>. Yes, UX team and scrum, two <strong>big novelties in 2008</strong>.</p>
          <p class="body-xlarge mt-medium">It was like a second school to me, the <strong>UX Design school.</strong>
          </p>
          <p class="mt-medium">There I learned a lot from professionals like <strong>Felipe Memória</strong> founder of Work &amp; Co. and has just launched a new app for the <strong>iconic</strong>
            <strong>metro map of New York</strong>. I’m also talking about <strong>Lucas Hirata</strong> who is a Lead Designer at Google, <strong>Thadeu Morgado</strong> also partner designer at Work &amp; Co., among others.</p>
              <h5 class="mt-medium">User Centred Mindset 🤓</h5>
              <p class="mt-small">This experience brought to me, and it has followed me during my career, this <strong>strategic mindset</strong> of <strong>putting the user in the center</strong>. Understand <strong>who they are</strong>, <strong>wear their shoes</strong>, and <strong>advocate for them</strong>. <strong>Content is king</strong>, <strong>storytelling</strong> and things like that. However, at that time, we were <strong>not including the user in the process</strong> to share information and validate the hypothesis. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="container-large">
              <p class="body-xlarge mt-medium">We were creating assumptions and <strong>deciding between us which path to follow without consulting them</strong>. Today we know it&#x27;s not enough.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container-medium">
              <h3 class="mt-large">Skidun Agency | 2010 - 2015</h3>
              <p class="mt-small">Then I worked for a digital agency, <strong>Skidun</strong>, for almost 5 years. I started creating <strong>corporate websites</strong>, by gathering the <strong>requirements with the client</strong>, conceptualizing the solution via <strong>wireframes</strong>, <strong>sitemaps</strong> and <strong>user flows</strong>, <strong>presenting it to the client</strong>, crafting the <strong>final layouts</strong>, and <strong>testing the HTML</strong> coded by <strong>external developers.</strong>
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="container-large">
              <p class="body-xlarge mt-medium">I was <strong>leading projects</strong> since day one.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="container-medium">
              <h5 class="mt-medium">— Initiative 💪🏽</h5>
              <p class="mt-small">The <strong>quality of the final</strong>
                <strong>delivery</strong> was always less than I expected. So I suggested that I start to code these projects by myself. At the end of the first year, <strong>I was doing the entire project</strong> almost alone, including the <strong>back-end</strong> since I brought <strong>WordPress as a CMS</strong> to the agency&#x27;s catalog. I was also responsible for <strong>interactive hot-sites</strong>, <strong>web portals</strong>, and a few <strong>web apps</strong>. It was <strong>too much for one</strong>
                <strong>person</strong>, it wasn’t scalable, therefore I started to delegate.</p>
                  <h5 class="mt-medium">
                    <strong>— Growth 🪜</strong>
                  </h5>
                  <p class="mt-small">The agency has grown a lot, from <strong>6 employess when I arrived</strong> to around <strong>50 when I left</strong>. I started as a <strong>junior</strong> and was <strong>leading a team</strong> of 5 developers, and being the <strong>only UX specialist</strong> when I left.</p>
                  <h3 class="mt-large">Soldout Agency | 2014 - 2017</h3>
                  <p class="mt-small">In 2014 I found an agency, in the <strong>entertainment events industry</strong>. I was <strong>leaving the UX field </strong>to focus on the <strong>creative direction</strong> of events’ campaigns. In 2,5 years I did <strong>dozens of events</strong>. We were <strong>very successful</strong>, I made more money than I ever had, but soon I realized that producing campaigns to <strong>sell tickets for parties</strong> was not a fulfilling job. So I left.</p>
                  <h5 class="mt-medium">
                    <strong>— Data-driven 🧐</strong>
                  </h5>
                  <p class="mt-small">One cool thing from that time was to see the <strong>result of my work in numbers</strong>. We were using mental models like <strong>scarcity</strong>, <strong>urgency</strong>, <strong>exclusivity</strong>, <strong>loss aversion</strong>, and the <strong>paradox of choice</strong>, among others to <strong>drive sales</strong>. When an ad worked the <strong>sales ramp up rapidly</strong>, and that was great! </p>
                </div>
                <div class="container-large">
                  <p class="body-xlarge mt-medium">As a performance agency, we were totally <strong>data-driven</strong>.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="container-medium">
                  <h3 class="mt-large">TAP | 2017 - 2019</h3>
                  <p class="mt-small">In 2017 I moved to Portugal and started a <strong>Product Designer position at TAP</strong>, the airline company. I was designing <strong>internal products</strong>, most of them <strong>responsive</strong> (mobile and desktop), some <strong>mobile-only</strong>, and a few <strong>TV dashboards</strong> that grant us an <strong>award from the US</strong>.</p>
                  <h5 class="mt-medium">— Close to end-users 👌🏽</h5>
                  <p class="mt-small">It was nice to create <strong>internal tools</strong> for TAP mostly because I was very <strong>close to the end users</strong>, therefore I could easily <strong>run an interview</strong>, or a <strong>usability test</strong>, make <strong>improvements</strong> and <strong>test again</strong>.</p>
                  <h3 class="mt-large">Vision-box | 2019 - 2022</h3>
                  <p class="mt-small">For the last 3 years, I’ve been working for <strong>Vision-box</strong>, designing <strong>biometric experiences</strong> for <strong>airports</strong>, <strong>airlines</strong>, and <strong>border control</strong> all <strong>over the world</strong>. As the <strong>most senior member</strong> of a <strong>recently created design team</strong>, I built<strong> two design systems</strong> and a process for the team to <strong>deliver experiences</strong>. </p>
                  <h5 class="mt-medium">— Team Work ✊🏽</h5>
                  <p class="mt-small">I collaborate with <strong>UX researchers</strong>, <strong>Industrial designers</strong>, <strong>project</strong> and <strong>product managers</strong>, <strong>QAs</strong>, and <strong>engineers</strong>. My responsibilities include <strong>auditing current solutions,</strong>
                    <strong>promoting workshops</strong>, creating <strong>user journeys</strong> and <strong>UIs</strong>, and <strong>prototyping</strong>, <strong>validating</strong>, and delivering <strong>production-ready artifacts</strong> for development.</p>
                      <h5 class="mt-medium">— Distant from end-users 👎🏽</h5>
                      <p class="mt-small">It&#x27;s nice to work in the <strong>biometric air travel</strong> industry, I have <strong>my mark in many airports around the globe</strong>, like Japan, Australia, Finland, UK, Qatar, and America and I <strong>advocate for users in critical moments</strong> of their lives. </p>
